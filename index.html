    <p> She began her career under the name Kayleigh Rose by releasing four singles, along with their respective music videos, titled “Die Young”, “I Don’t Love You”, “Crave You”, and “Tell Me Again”. “Die Young”, in particular, drew the attention of Australian singer Troye Sivan, who later helped Roan get noticed by a record label. After signing to Atlantic Records, she began to use the stage name Chappell Roan, which was created in honor of her grandfather Dennis K. Chappell, and his favorite song, “The Strawberry Roan”.</p>

<p> Roan released her first extended play on the label, School Nights, along with the songs “Bitter” and “School Nights” (unrelated to the EP). The EP was toured as an opening act for multiple artists, and Roan mentioned she had started work on an album intended for release in 2018. However, it was later scrapped when Roan decided to take a stylistic departure from her older works. After begging her label, she released “Pink Pony Club” in 2020. Roan would proceed to release two final songs with the label, before being dropped due to her music “underperforming”.</p>

<p>  Roan felt like there was nothing else for her to do, and returned to her hometown in Missouri and worked as a nanny and barista. Her long time collaborator, Dan Nigro, though, convinced her to give music one more shot. For a year, they released multiple singles with help from friends, and created a close-knit community. Nigro would end up creating a new record label, Amusement Records, specifically to sign Roan. In 2023, she released her first studio album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, and was met with incredibly positive reviews.</p>
